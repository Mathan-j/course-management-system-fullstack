# Course Management System

This document outlines the architecture, technology stack, and operational flow of the Course Management System, including its AI integration.

## 1. Project Overview

The Course Management System is a full-stack web application designed to facilitate the creation, management, and consumption of educational courses. It provides functionalities for user authentication, course CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and an AI-powered explanation feature for concepts within courses.

**Deployed Application:** You can access the live deployed application here: [https://course-frontend-app.onrender.com](https://course-frontend-app.onrender.com)

## 2. Technology Stack

The project leverages a modern MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack with additional libraries and frameworks:

### Frontend:
*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Redux Toolkit:** For efficient state management across the application.
*   **React Router DOM:** For declarative routing within the single-page application.
*   **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to the backend.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and consistent styling.
*   **Vite:** A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
*   **React Quill:** A rich text editor component for handling course content.

### Backend:
*   **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
*   **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
*   **MongoDB:** A NoSQL document database for storing application data.
*   **Mongoose:** An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, simplifying data interactions.
*   **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** For secure user authentication and authorization.
*   **CORS:** Middleware to enable cross-origin resource sharing.
*   **Dotenv:** For loading environment variables from a .env file.

### AI Integration:
*   **OpenAI API:** Utilized by the backend to generate explanations for course concepts.

## 3. Project Flow (High-Level)

1.  **User Interaction (Frontend):** Users access the application through their web browser, interacting with the React-based user interface.
2.  **API Requests (Frontend to Backend):** The React frontend communicates with the Node.js backend via RESTful API calls (using Axios) to fetch, create, update, or delete data.
3.  **Data Management (Backend & Database):** The Node.js backend processes these requests, interacts with the MongoDB database (via Mongoose) to store and retrieve data, and performs business logic.
4.  **AI Processing (Backend to OpenAI):** For specific features (e.g., concept explanations), the backend makes requests to the OpenAI API, processes the AI's response, and sends it back to the frontend.

## 4. Detailed Project Flow

### 4.1. Backend (`backend/` directory)

The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, handling API requests, database interactions, and AI integration.

*   `server.js` (Main Entry Point):
    *   Initializes the Express application.
    *   Configures CORS to allow requests from the frontend's origin (http://localhost:5174, and deployed Render URLs).
    *   Connects to the MongoDB database using `connectDB()`.
    *   Sets up middleware for parsing JSON request bodies (`express.json()`).
    *   Defines and mounts API routes for authentication, courses, explanations, and quizzes.
    *   Starts the server, listening on a specified port (e.g., 5000).
*   `config/db.js` (Database Connection):
    *   Contains the `connectDB` function responsible for establishing a connection to MongoDB using Mongoose.
    *   Uses `process.env.MONGO_URI` to get the database connection string from environment variables.
*   `models/` (Data Models):
    *   `User.js`: Defines the Mongoose schema for user data (e.g., name, email, password, role).
    *   `Course.js`: Defines the Mongoose schema for course data (e.g., title, description, category, difficulty, instructor).
    *   (Other models like `Explanation` or `Quiz` might exist or be implicitly handled within controllers if not requiring dedicated schemas).
*   `routes/` (API Routes):
    *   `authRoutes.js`: Defines API endpoints related to user authentication (e.g., `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`).
    *   `courseRoutes.js`: Defines API endpoints for managing courses (e.g., `/api/courses`, `/api/courses/:id`).
    *   `explanationRoutes.js`: Defines API endpoints for AI-powered explanations (e.g., `/api/explain`).
    *   `quizRoutes.js`: Defines API endpoints for quizzes (e.g., `/api/quiz`).
*   `controllers/` (Business Logic):
    *   `authController.js`: Contains the logic for user registration (hashing passwords, saving to DB) and login (verifying credentials, generating JWTs).
    *   `courseController.js`: Implements the logic for CRUD operations on courses (e.g., fetching all courses, creating a new course, updating an existing one, deleting courses).
    *   `explanationController.js`: Handles the interaction with the OpenAI API to generate explanations based on user input.
    *   `quizController.js`: Manages quiz-related logic, potentially including generating quizzes using AI or handling quiz submissions.
*   `middleware/` (Request Processing):
    *   `authMiddleware.js`: Verifies the JWT token present in the request headers to protect authenticated routes. It extracts user information (like ID and role) from the token and attaches it to the request object.
    *   `roleMiddleware.js`: Checks if the authenticated user has a specific role (e.g., 'admin') to restrict access to certain routes.
*   `.env`: Stores sensitive information and configuration variables (e.g., `PORT`, `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`).

### 4.2. Frontend (`frontend/` directory)

The frontend is a React single-page application that consumes the backend APIs.

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the React application.
*   `main.jsx`: The primary JavaScript entry point, responsible for rendering the root React component (`App.jsx`) into the DOM. It also sets up Redux Provider and React Router.
*   `App.jsx`: The main application component, responsible for setting up the application's routing using `react-router-dom`. It defines the different pages and their paths.
*   `redux/` (State Management):
    *   `store.js`: Configures the Redux store, combining different slices.
    *   `coursesSlice.js`: A Redux Toolkit slice that manages the state related to courses (e.g., list of courses, loading status, errors). It includes asynchronous thunks for fetching, adding, updating, and deleting courses by dispatching actions that interact with the backend API.
*   `pages/` (Application Views):
    *   `LoginSignup.jsx`: Provides the user interface for user registration and login.
    *   `Home.jsx`: Displays a list of courses, implements search, filter, sort, pagination, and bulk actions. It fetches course data from the Redux store.
    *   `CourseDetail.jsx`: Shows detailed information about a specific course.
    *   `CreateCourse.jsx`: Form for creating new courses.
    *   `EditCourse.jsx`: Form for editing existing courses.
    *   `ExplainConcept.jsx`: User interface for interacting with the AI explanation feature.
    *   `Dashboard.jsx`: (If implemented) A user dashboard.
*   `components/` (Reusable UI Components):
    *   `Navbar.jsx`: The application's navigation bar.
    *   `PrivateRoute.jsx`: A routing component that protects routes, ensuring only authenticated users can access them.
    *   `ErrorBoundary.jsx`: A React component that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component tree, logs those errors, and displays a fallback UI.
    *   `Quiz.jsx`: Component for displaying and interacting with quizzes.
*   `utils/axiosInstance.js` (API Client):
    *   Configures an Axios instance with a `baseURL` (obtained from `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL`).
    *   Includes an Axios interceptor to automatically attach the JWT authentication token to outgoing requests if available in `localStorage`.
*   `.env`: Stores frontend-specific environment variables (e.g., `VITE_API_BASE_URL`).

## 5. AI Integration (OpenAI)

*   **How it Works:**
    *   The frontend (e.g., `ExplainConcept.jsx`) sends a request to the backend with the concept to be explained.
    *   The backend's `explanationController.js` receives this request.
    *   It then uses the `openai` Node.js library to make a request to the OpenAI API (e.g., the GPT model).
    *   The prompt sent to OpenAI typically includes the concept and instructions on how to generate the explanation.
    *   OpenAI processes the request and returns a generated text explanation.
    *   The backend sends this explanation back to the frontend.
*   **Language Used for AI Code:** The AI integration code is written in JavaScript (Node.js), as it's part of the existing Node.js backend.
*   **Why Not Python?** While Python is widely used for AI/ML development due to its extensive libraries and community, this project's backend is already established in Node.js. It's generally more efficient and maintainable to keep the backend in a single language. The OpenAI API is a RESTful API, meaning it can be consumed from any programming language that can make HTTP requests, including Node.js. There's no technical necessity to introduce Python solely for this integration when a robust Node.js client library for OpenAI exists.
*   **How Many AIs?** Based on the current project structure, the system integrates with one primary AI service: OpenAI. It leverages OpenAI's large language models (like GPT) to provide text-based explanations. There isn't an indication of multiple distinct AI models or services being used for different purposes within the application.
